Thefiles and their descriptions are as follows:Oakhill - contains the ACT-R model of the Oakhill task. The parameters set          at the beginning of this file are the optimal parameters.          Run Spring Oakhill Model.lisp - runs the simulation. ACT-R must be loaded before                              this file. Requires the following file.          LoadSpringData.lisp - sets up and fills the 3 arrays needed to run the simulation.                    Requires the following 3 files.                    s98data.txt - the characters presented to the subjects, listed in orders98str.txt - the number of letters in each string presenteds98trial.txt - the trial information (i.e., how many strings on each trial and               the string size)               OptimizeSpringOakhill.lisp - runs the optimizer on the fall model and data. Attempts                            to fit 22 points - the 4 accuracy points + 18 serial                           position points. ACT-R and the Optimizer must be loaded                           before loading this file. Requires all of the files                            listed above.There is also a subdirectory called Spring W Runs. This contains my originalmodel fits using values of W separated by 0.1.
